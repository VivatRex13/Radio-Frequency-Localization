# Radio-Frequency-Localization
This is a radio frequency localization program.

Location of a radio is extremely valuable, especially for the safety of first responders, so radio-frequency localization is useful in lieu of sufficient Global Positioning Systems signal. In this report, I describe a method of localizing a node of unknown position, the roaming node, using radio-frequency ranging to several stationary radio nodes of known positions: one reference node, the leader node, and several follower nodes. I will describe how the follower nodes use 2-way ranges to synchronize their time with the leader node. I will also describe how by overhearing the 2-way ranging between the leader and roaming nodes, the follower nodes use time differences of arrival and a gradient descent algorithm to find the position of the roaming node. The results yielded an approximate error between the estimated and real position of the roaming node of 0.7 meters, which was larger than expected, likely due to a clock that suffered from a large amount of drift. Future research will include optimizing the localization algorithm and using more accurate radio models.
